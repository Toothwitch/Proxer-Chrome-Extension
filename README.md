## Proxer Chrome Extension
Chrome Extension for the popular German Anime Streaming Site Proxer.me

2. If zipped unpack it
3. Goto you Chrome into chrome://extensions (the extensions tab)
4. If not already activated, activate developer mode
5. Use button "Load unzipped extension..." and direct to the folder of this extension

####  What this does
At the moment this extension is able to let you log into proxer.me 
while not even being at the site and display all your open notifications(just counts no more info)

As soon as the API expands more functionality will be added!
